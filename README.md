# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

Project 11 tasks the student with building an express server using Node.js that takes an already build note taker front and and ties it to the server functionality created by the student. This project challenged the student with figuring out how to use the express app methods to retreive information
from a JSON file, post new notes using the UI, and delete existing notes from the UI in the server logic. This project solved the problem of how does everything come together in a full stack application with the relationship to the UI and database.

## Installation

To install this application, first fork and clone the github repo. Once the repo is on your local machine, you can start the server by running the "node server.js" command. This will initilize the server on PORT 3004 on your local machine. From here, you can open up the application using the local
host URL http://localhost:3004/

## Usage

To use this application, either host the application on a server or on your local machine after running the "node server.js" command. Then, click the ADD NOTE button. Once on the /notes page you can add a new note and save it using the save icon. Once saved, the new note will appear in the right
hand side of the /notes page. You can also delete the note by using the trashcan icon next to the specific note.
